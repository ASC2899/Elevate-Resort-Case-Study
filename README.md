## üõ† DAX Measures Used

Some key DAX formulas created:

```DAX
-- Total Real Revenue
Real_Revenue = 
IF(
    OR(hotel_bookings[deposit_type] = "Non Refund", hotel_bookings[is_cancelled] = 0),
    hotel_bookings[adr] * (hotel_bookings[stays_in_week_nights] + hotel_bookings[stays_in_weekend_nights]),
    0
)

-- Revenue Lost from Cancellations
Revenue_Lost = 
IF(
    AND(hotel_bookings[deposit_type] <> "Non Refund", hotel_bookings[is_cancelled] = 1),
    hotel_bookings[adr] * (hotel_bookings[stays_in_week_nights] + hotel_bookings[stays_in_weekend_nights]) * -1,
    BLANK()
)
```
